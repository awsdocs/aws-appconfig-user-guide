| [AWS AppConfig integration with Atlassian Jira ](#doc-history) | Integrating with Atlassian Jira allows AWS AppConfig to create and update issues in the Atlassian console whenever you make changes to a [feature flag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile.html#appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile-feature-flags) in your AWS account for the specified AWS Region\. Each Jira issue includes the flag name, application ID, configuration profile ID, and flag values\. After you update, save, and deploy your flag changes, Jira updates the existing issues with the details of the change\. For more information, see [AWS AppConfig integration with Atlassian Jira](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-jira.html)\. | April 7, 2022 | 
| [General availability of feature flags and Lambda extension support for ARM64 \(Graviton2\) processors](#doc-history) | With AWS AppConfig feature flags, you can develop a new feature and deploy it to production while hiding the feature from users\. You start by adding the flag to AWS AppConfig as configuration data\. Once the feature is ready to be released, you can update the flag configuration data without deploying any code\. This feature improves the safety of your dev\-ops environment because you don't need to deploy new code to release the feature\. For more information, see [Creating a feature flag configuration profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile.html#appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile-feature-flags)\.General availability of feature flags in AWS AppConfig includes the following enhancements:  The console includes an option to designate a flag as a *short term* flag\. You can filter and sort the list of flags on short\-term flags\.   For customers using feature flags in AWS Lambda, the new Lambda extension allows you to call individual feature flags by using an HTTP endpoint\. For more information, see see [Retrieving one or more flags from a feature flag configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions-retrieving-flags.html)\.  This update also provides support for AWS Lambda extensions developed for ARM64 \(Graviton2\) processors\. For more information, see see [Available versions of the AWS AppConfig Lambda extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions-versions.html)\.  | March 15, 2022 | 
| [The GetConfiguration API action is deprecated](#doc-history) | The `GetConfiguration` API action is deprecated\. Calls to receive configuration data should use the `StartConfigurationSession` and `GetLatestConfiguration` APIs instead\. For more information about these APIs and how to use them, see [Retrieving the configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-retrieving-the-configuration.html)\. | January 28, 2022 | 
| [New region ARN for AWS AppConfig Lambda extension](#doc-history) | AWS AppConfig Lambda extension is available in the new Asia Pacific \(Osaka\) region\.

For more information about the Asia Pacific \(Osaka\) region ARN, see [Adding the AWS AppConfig Lambda extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions.html#appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions-enabling)\. | March 4, 2021 | 
| [AWS AppConfig Lambda extension](#doc-history) | If you use AWS AppConfig to manage configurations for a Lambda function, then we recommend that you add the AWS AppConfig Lambda extension\. This extension includes best practices that simplify using AWS AppConfig while reducing costs\. Reduced costs result from fewer API calls to the AWS AppConfig service and, separately, reduced costs from shorter Lambda function processing times\. For more information, see [AWS AppConfig integration with Lambda extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions.html)\. | October 8, 2020 |

| [Launch of AWS AppConfig user guide](#doc-history) | Use AWS AppConfig, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations\.
