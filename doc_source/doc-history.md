The following table describes the important changes to the documentation since the last release of AWS AppConfig\.

**Current API version: 2019\-10\-09**

| Change | Description | Date | 
| --- |--- |--- |
| [AWS AppConfig integration with AWS Secrets Manager](#doc-history) | AWS AppConfig integrates with AWS Secrets Manager\. Secrets Manager helps you to securely encrypt, store, and retrieve credentials for your databases and other services\. Instead of hardcoding credentials in your apps, you can make calls to Secrets Manager to retrieve your credentials whenever needed\. Secrets Manager helps you protect access to your IT resources and data by enabling you to rotate and manage access to your secrets\.When you create a freeform configuration profile, you can choose Secrets Manager as the source of your configuration data\. You must onboard with Secrets Manager and create a secret before you create the configuration profile\. For more information about Secrets Manager, see [What is AWS Secrets Manager?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*\. For information about creating a configuration profile, see [Creating a freeform configuration profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile.html#appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile-free-form-configurations)\. | February 2, 2023 | 
| [AWS AppConfig integration with Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS](#doc-history) | You can integrate AWS AppConfig with Amazon Elastic Container Service \(Amazon ECS\) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\) by using the AWS AppConfig agent\. The agent functions as a sidecar container running alongside your Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS container applications\. The agent enhances containerized application processing and management in the following ways:  The agent calls AWS AppConfig on your behalf by using an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role and managing a local cache of configuration data\. By pulling configuration data from the local cache, your application requires fewer code updates to manage configuration data, retrieves configuration data in milliseconds, and isn't affected by network issues that can disrupt calls for such data\.   The agent offers a native experience for retrieving and resolving AWS AppConfig feature flags\.   Out of the box, the agent provides best practices for caching strategies, polling intervals, and local configuration data availability while tracking the configuration tokens needed for subsequent service calls\.   While running in the background, the agent periodically polls the AWS AppConfig data plane for configuration data updates\. Your containerized application can retrieve the data by connecting to localhost on port 2772 \(a customizable default port value\) and calling HTTP GET to retrieve the data\.   The AWS AppConfig agent updates configuration data in your containers without having to restart or recycle those containers\.  For more information, see [AWS AppConfig integration with Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-containers-agent.html)\. | December 2, 2022 | 
| [New extension: AWS AppConfig extension for CloudWatch Evidently](#doc-history) | You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature\. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users\. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature\. You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and data\.The AWS AppConfig extension for CloudWatch Evidently allows your application to assign variations to user sessions locally instead of by calling the [EvaluateFeature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFeature.html) operation\. A local session mitigates the latency and availability risks that come with an API call\. For information about how to configure and use the extension, see [Perform launches and A/B experiments with CloudWatch Evidently](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\. | September 13, 2022 | 
| [Deprecation of the `GetConfiguration` API action](#doc-history) | On Nov 18, 2021, AWS AppConfig released a new data plane service\. This service replaces the previous process of retrieving configuration data by using the `GetConfiguration` API action\. The data plane service uses two new API actions, [StartConfigurationSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_StartConfigurationSession.html) and [GetLatestConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_GetLatestConfiguration.html)\. The data plane service also uses [new endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/appconfig.html#appconfigdata_data_plane)\.For more information, see [About the AWS AppConfig data plane service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/about-data-plane.html)\. | September 13, 2022 |

For more information, see [AWS AppConfig integration with Atlassian Jira](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-jira.html)\. | April 7, 2022 | 
| [General availability of feature flags and Lambda extension support for ARM64 \(Graviton2\) processors](#doc-history) | With AWS AppConfig feature flags, you can develop a new feature and deploy it to production while hiding the feature from users\. You start by adding the flag to AWS AppConfig as configuration data\. Once the feature is ready to be released, you can update the flag configuration data without deploying any code\. This feature improves the safety of your dev\-ops environment because you don't need to deploy new code to release the feature\. For more information, see [Creating a feature flag configuration profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile.html#appconfig-creating-configuration-and-profile-feature-flags)\.General availability of feature flags in AWS AppConfig includes the following enhancements:  The console includes an option to designate a flag as a *short term* flag\. You can filter and sort the list of flags on short\-term flags\.   For customers using feature flags in AWS Lambda, the new Lambda extension allows you to call individual feature flags by using an HTTP endpoint\. For more information, see see [Retrieving one or more flags from a feature flag configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions-retrieving-flags.html)\.  This update also provides support for AWS Lambda extensions developed for ARM64 \(Graviton2\) processors\. For more information, see see [Available versions of the AWS AppConfig Lambda extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions-versions.html)\.  | March 15, 2022 | 
| [The GetConfiguration API action is deprecated](#doc-history) | The `GetConfiguration` API action is deprecated\. Calls to receive configuration data should use the `StartConfigurationSession` and `GetLatestConfiguration` APIs instead\. For more information about these APIs and how to use them, see [Retrieving the configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-retrieving-the-configuration.html)\. | January 28, 2022 |
