# Step 5: Deploying a configuration<a name="appconfig-deploying"></a>

Starting a deployment in AWS AppConfig calls the [StartDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_StartDeployment.html) API operation\. This call includes the IDs of the AWS AppConfig application, the environment, the configuration profile, and \(optionally\) the configuration data version to deploy\. The call also includes the ID of the deployment strategy to use, which determines how the configuration data is deployed\.

If you deploy secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager, Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) objects encrypted with a customer managed key, or secure string parameters stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store encrypted with a customer managed key, you must specify a value for the `KmsKeyIdentifier` parameter\. If your configuration is not encrypted or is encrypted with an AWS managed key, specifying a value for the `KmsKeyIdentifier` parameter is not required\.

**Note**  
The value you specify for `KmsKeyIdentifier` must be a customer managed key\. This doesn't have to be the same key you used to encrypt your configuration\.  
When you start a deployment with a `KmsKeyIdentifier`, the permission poilcy attached to your AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) principal must allow the `kms:GenerateDataKey` operation\.

AWS AppConfig monitors the distribution to all hosts and reports status\. If a distribution fails, then AWS AppConfig rolls back the configuration\.

**Note**  
You can only deploy one configuration at a time to an Environment\. However, you can deploy one configuration each to different Environments at the same time\.

## Deploy a configuration \(console\)<a name="appconfig-deploying-console"></a>

Use the following procedure to deploy an AWS AppConfig configuration by using the AWS Systems Manager console\.

**To deploy a configuration by using the console**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/appconfig/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/appconfig/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AWS AppConfig**\.

1. On the **Applications** tab, choose an application, and then choose **View details**\.

1. On the **Environments** tab, choose an environment, and then choose **View details**\.

1. Choose **Start deployment**\.

1. For **Configuration**, choose a configuration from the list\.

1. Depending on the source of your configuration, use the **Document version** or **Parameter version** list to choose the version you want to deploy\. 

1. For **Deployment strategy**, choose a strategy from the list\.

1. For **Deployment description**, enter a description\. 

1. In the **Tags** section, enter a key and an optional value\. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags for a resource\. 

1. Choose **Start deployment**\.

## Deploy a configuration \(commandline\)<a name="appconfig-deploying-commandline"></a>

The following procedure describes how to use the AWS CLI \(on Linux or Windows\) or AWS Tools for PowerShell to deploy an AWS AppConfig configuration\.

**To deploy a configuration step by step**

1. Open the AWS CLI\.

1. Run the following command to deploy a configuration\. 

------
#### [ Linux ]

   ```
   aws appconfig start-deployment \
     --application-id The_application_ID \
     --environment-id The_environment_ID \
     --deployment-strategy-id The_deployment_strategy_ID \
     --configuration-profile-id The_configuration_profile_ID \
     --configuration-version The_configuration_version_to_deploy \
     --description A_description_of_the_deployment \
     --tags User_defined_key_value_pair_metadata_of_the_deployment
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

   ```
   aws appconfig start-deployment ^
     --application-id The_application_ID ^
     --environment-id The_environment_ID ^
     --deployment-strategy-id The_deployment_strategy_ID ^
     --configuration-profile-id The_configuration_profile_ID ^
     --configuration-version The_configuration_version_to_deploy ^
     --description A_description_of_the_deployment ^
     --tags User_defined_key_value_pair_metadata_of_the_deployment
   ```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

   ```
   Start-APPCDeployment `
     -ApplicationId The_application_ID `
     -ConfigurationProfileId The_configuration_profile_ID `
     -ConfigurationVersion The_configuration_version_to_deploy `
     -DeploymentStrategyId The_deployment_strategy_ID `
     -Description A_description_of_the_deployment `
     -EnvironmentId The_environment_ID `
     -Tag Hashtable_type_user_defined_key_value_pair_metadata_of_the_deployment
   ```

------

   The system returns information like the following\.
